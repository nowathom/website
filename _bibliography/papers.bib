  abstract = {Understanding how delivery and exchange of genetic information by
              bacteriophages shapes bacterial populations is important for
              designing applications for phage therapy, biocontrol, and
              microbiome engineering. Here, we present a synthetic intercellular
              communication system that repurposes phage M13 for genetic exchange
              between Escherichia coli cells and build mathematical models of the
              communication behaviour. Our models, based on Chemical Reaction
              Networks, capture the growth burden, cell density, and growth phase
              dependence of phage secretion and infection kinetics and predict
              the stochasticity characterising phage-bacterial interactions at
              low numbers. In co-cultures of phage sender and receiver cells,
              resource sharing and selection pressure determine the choice of
              horizontal versus vertical phage transmission. Surprisingly, we
              discover that a phage-encoded immunity factor confers extracellular
              protection to uninfected bacteria, reducing infection rates by 70\%
              . In a simulated gut environment, this novel {\textquotedblleft}
              self-jamming{\textquotedblright} mechanism enables the phage to
              farm uninfected bacteria for future infections, increasing the
              overall success of both M13 and E. coli. The synthetic system
              developed here lays the groundwork for implementing population
              level controls in engineered bacterial communities, using phage
              signals for communication.Competing Interest StatementThe authors
